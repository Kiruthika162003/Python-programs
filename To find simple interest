# Python3 program to find simple interest
# for given principal amount, time and
# rate of interest.


def simple_interest(p,t,r):
	print('The principal is', p)
	print('The time period is', t)
	print('The rate of interest is',r)
	
	si = (p * t * r)/100
	
	print('The Simple Interest is', si)
	return si
	

simple_interest(8, 6, 8)


Output:
The principal is 8
The time period is 6
The rate of interest is 8
The Simple Interest is 3.84
